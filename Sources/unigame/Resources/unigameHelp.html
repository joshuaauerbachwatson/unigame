		<a name="Assembling" />How to Connect Players
	</h2>

    <p>
        %appName% does not provide any "social" features.  Rather, players need to arrange
        in advance to play together.
        These instructions assume you have already identified the players who will play together
        and now want to connect them to each other.  Each such player must have installed %appName%
        on a device.

	<p>
		After installing and starting the game, touch the <b>Players</b>
		button to bring up a dialog that looks like the picture. <img
			alt="initial players dialog" src="./playerDialogInitial.png">
	</p>

	<p>
		The first time you do this, <b>Your User Name</b> will be whatever
		name you gave to your device (usually not too meaningful to others).
		Touch the white text box to bring up the keyboard and replace the name
		with a name that you want to be known by when playing. Players who
		will play together should choose distinct names.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Exactly one player in the group of players must be the leader.  That player will actually set up the
		game (deal out the cards, do whatever else is required).  The leader also sets the number of players
		that are expected. Touch the blue text to the right of the <b>Are you leader?</b> label to
		toggle back and forth between being the leader and not.  Notice that the <b>Number of players</b>
		stepper appears and disappears accordingly, as does the <b>Setup Game</b> button at the top of
		the app window (not shown in the picture).
	</p>
		  
	<p>
		Decide who in your group will be the leader.  That player should select <b>Yes</b> and the others should select <b>No</b>.
        The player who is leader should then set the number of players.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		There are two ways for players to connect to each other (the <b>Players source</b>), called <b>Nearby
			only</b> and <b>Entire internet</b>. One of these modes is shown in blue.
		Touching the blue text toggles between the two modes.  All players must select the same mode.
	</p>

	<h3>Nearby Only Mode</h3>

	<p>
		In the <b>Nearby only</b> mode, players must be near each other
		(within bluetooth range or on the same wifi hub). All such players are
		assumed to be playing with each other. Once all players have set the <b>Nearby
		only</b> mode, and a single player has assumed the leader role and set the number
		of players, all players may then touch the <b>Find Players</b> button to move on
		to actual play.
	</p>

	<h3>Entire Internet Mode</h3>

	<p>
		When you switch to <b>Entire Internet</b> mode, the players can be
		anywhere, as long as they each have an internet connection active on
        their device. An additional <b>Token</b> field (and sometimes additional buttons) will appear as
        in the picture. <img
            alt="entire internet mode" src="./playerDialogInternet.png">
		All players must touch the token field and then fill it in using the same value.
		Once this is true, all players can touch <b>Find Players</b> and move on to actual play.
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li>The <em>token</em> is a value chosen by a group of players to distinguish
            if from other groups of players.  It should be hard to guess, so that no other %appName% players can
            crash your game and groups of players don't collide with each other.</li>
		<li>The game token must be made up of letters and numbers only.  Upper and lower
		case letters are distinct (case is meaningful).</li>
        <li>The token must be exactly 12 characters long.  The entry field will stop accepting new characters when 12
            have been entered.  If there are too few, there will be an error popup when you exit text entry or press the
        <b>Find Players</b> button.</li>
        </li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Remembering and retrieving tokens</h4>
	<p>
		Since it takes some effort for a group to come up with a token and for all players to enter it,
		%appName% provides the ability to remember tokens.  A remembered token can have a "nickname" to help you remember
        its purpose.
        <img alt="remember token dialog" src="./rememberTokenDialog.png">
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When a valid and complete token has been entered, an
			additional <b>Remember this Token</b> button will appear. If you
			touch this button, you will get a confirmation dialog that looks like
			the picture. Touch <b>Confirm</b> to remember the token.  If you wish, you can
			first enter text in the optional "nickname" field.  This will associate a nickname
			to remind you of the purpose of the token. You can remember multiple tokens.
		</li>
		<li>If you have any remembered tokens, one of them will appear in
			the <b>Token</b> field the next time you open the <b>Players</b>
			dialog. There will also be another button labelled <b>Use saved
				token</b>. Touching this button will bring up a selection list from
			which you can select any of your saved tokens. You can also delete
			saved tokens from this selection list by sliding the selection left
			to reveal a delete button.
		</li>
		<li>When tokens have assigned nicknames, they appear in the <b>Token</b>
			field (and in the selection list for using saved tokens) with the
			nickname before the token, separated by a colon (e.g. <b>Bilbo:
				Bilbobaggins</b>). Only the token is shared with other players, however.
			The nickname is just for your private use and is always optional.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<a name="Problems" />Reporting Problems
	</h2>
	<p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.
		Touching it will bring up an initialized email sending view with the
		recipient set to the %appName% reporting address and some instructions
		in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with
		your specific problem report).</p>
	<p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or
		input that you like, but a key purpose is to support reporting bugs
		and other problems that you are having with the app. To this end, the
		email, by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent
		activity. When you are reporting a serious problem, such as a crash or
		misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
		place since they help in diagnosing problems. They include only
		information about recent sequences of actions inside the app itself
		and do not include any personal information. However, if you feel more
		comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
