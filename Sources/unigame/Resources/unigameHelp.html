    <p>
        %appName% does not provide "social" functions for finding like-minded players.  Rather, players who want to play
        together must communicate ahead of time and agree on a few things.
        <ul><li>They must agree on one of them to be "leader".  The leader is responsible for
            specifying the number of players.  Once all players have assembled, the leader is responsible for game setup,
            if any is required, and either takes the first turn or passes it to the next player.  After that,
            the leader is just like any other player.</li>
            <li>They must agree on whether they will play in "Nearby Only" mode.  In this mode, users must be in proximity
                to each other (in bluetooth range or on the same wifi hub).  This mode allows the Login step to be bypassed.
                If "Nearby Only" is not chosen, players can be anywhere on the internet but must identify themselves via
                a Login step.</li>
            <li>They must agree on a "game token" that they will all use to identify the group.  This can be any string of
                upper and lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores, at least six characters long.  The game token
                can be meaningful and need not adhere to "password strength" rules but it is better if it is not too likely
                to be chosen by other groups.  The game token is what keeps different groups of players from merging into one
                bigger (unintended) group.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a name="Solitaire">Solitaire Mode</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        If you identify yourself as leader and set the number of players to one, you are in "solitaire mode".  No game
        token is needed and you can proceed from the player-control view to the game-playing views without further fuss.
        Solitaire mode is a good way to familiarize yourself with the overall look and feel of the game, and I recommend
        you use it for that purpose before playing real games with other players.  However, %appName% is not intended
        primarily as a solitaire game.

    <h2>
        <a name="Top">The Top Controls</a>
    </h2>

    <p>
		Most screens shown by %appName% have the following material at the top.
		<img alt="Top of Screen" src="./topView.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
	</p>
    
    <p>
        The <b>Players</b> row contains labels for all the players who are in the game.
        You are represented by the label <b>You</b>.  Other players will show up as they join the game.
        If the expected number of players is known, there may be player slots labelled as "missing" or "searching".
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A player label with a running figure in it is the player whose turn it is.  The other players will have standing figures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Below the <b>Players</b> row is a space where the latest chat message is shown.  A change to the contents of
        this area will serve as notice that another player has something to say.  In the picture, no chat has occurred
        yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Below the chat message area is a row with three buttons.
        <ol>
            <li>The <b>Chat</b> button opens the chat view, which provides a scrollable complete transcript
                of the chat messages since you joined the game.  A text entry area in this view allows you to
                send messages.  The <b>Chat</b> button is disabled until there are at least two players in the game.</li>
            <li>The <b>End Game</b> button ends the game.  It is disabled until you join the game.  Once it is enabled it
                remained so until you either touch it to end the game or some other player ends the game or the game ends
                due to some unrecoverable error.  Any player can end the game pre-emptively.
            <li>The <b>Help</b> button brings up this help view.  That button is always enabled.
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <a name="Assembling">Assembling Players</a>
    </h2>
    
	<p>
		When you first open the app, the center of the screen will be occupied by the player-control view, which looks
        like the following. <img alt="Assembling Players" src="./playersView.png"
            style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
	</p>
		
	<p>
        Where you see <b>I am: Logan Lester</b> in the picture, that is the name by which you will be known to
        the other players.  It will appear in chat messages sent by you and in the player labels in the other players'
        views.  The first time you play an arbitrary random name will appear there.  You can touch and then overtype this
        name to identify yourself in any way you prefer.  That change will be remembered.
    </p>

    <p>
		The <b>Leader</b> toggle allows you to assert that you are the Leader for the game.  As previously noted,
        only one player in the game should have this toggle on.  The others should have it off.
    </p>

    <p>
        The stepper for choosing the number o players will appear only if the <b>Leader</b> toggle is on.  This is
        how the leader sets the number of players.  It is also how you choose solitaire mode: by setting the number of
        players to one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The <b>Nearby Only</b> toggle must be set the same way by all the players.  Set it on if the players will be
        in close proximity and you wish to avoid the step of logging into the server.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The <b>Game token:</b> field is empty in the picture because no game token has been entered.  Every player in
        the game must be using the same game token.  To enter a new game token touch the <b>Add</b> button.  Once you have
        entered a game token, it will appear in the <b>Game token:</b> field every time until you delete it or enter a new
        one.  When you have used more than one game token without deleting, you can touch <b>Saved Game Tokens</b> to change
        which one is active.
	</p>
    
    <p>
        The portion of the view devoted to game tokens will disappear in solitaire mode.  You will not need a game token
        if you are not connecting to other players.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The two buttons <b>Login</b> and <b>Join</b> are shown at the bottom, unless you have chosen solitaire mode, in which
        case there will be a single <b>Play</b> button.  The <b>Login</b> button is enabled only if
        <ul><li><b>Nearby Only </b> is off</li>
            <li>you have not logged into the server in the last week</li>
        </ul>
        The <b>Join</b> button is enabled only if
        <ul><li><b>Login</b> is disabled</li>
            <li>you have a valid game token</li>
            <li>you have not yet joined the game</li>
        </ul>
        Once you join the game, the player-control view will continue to show with the <b>Players</b> area showing that not
        all players are present.  You can press <b>End Game</b> to cancel the operation of assembling players.  Once all
        players are assembled, %appName% will shift to its next view.

		<a name="Problems" />Reporting Problems
	</h2>
	<p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.
		Touching it will bring up an initialized email sending view with the
		recipient set to the %appName% reporting address and some instructions
		in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with
		your specific problem report).</p>
	<p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or
		input that you like, but a key purpose is to support reporting bugs
		and other problems that you are having with the app. To this end, the
		email, by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent
		activity. When you are reporting a serious problem, such as a crash or
		misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
		place since they help in diagnosing problems. They include only
		information about recent sequences of actions inside the app itself
		and do not include any personal information. However, if you feel more
		comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
