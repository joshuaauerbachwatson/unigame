        <a name="Problems" />Reporting Problems
    </h2>
    <p>At the top of this help text is a link for reporting problems.
        Touching it will bring up an initialized email sending view with the
        recipient set to the %appName% reporting address and some instructions
        in the body of the message (which you should delete and replace with
        your specific problem report).</p>
    <p>You can use this capabiity to send any kind of commentary or
        input that you like, but a key purpose is to support reporting bugs
        and other problems that you are having with the app. To this end, the
        email, by default, contains up to two (often just one) logs of recent
        activity. When you are reporting a serious problem, such as a crash or
        misbehavior of some sort, it is a good idea to leave these logs in
        place since they help in diagnosing problems. They include only
        information about recent sequences of actions inside the app itself
        and do not include any personal information. However, if you feel more
        comfortable removing these logs you are free to do so.</p>
