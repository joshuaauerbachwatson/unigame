### The client "starter package" for working with `unigame-server`

The `unigame-core` is a mixture of model-level code and SwiftUI classes designed to be used with `unigame-server`.  It is not a complete SwiftUI app.  Rather,
it is intended to be added as a package dependency to a real SwiftUI app that plays a game matching the overall unigame model.

Currently a work in progress.
